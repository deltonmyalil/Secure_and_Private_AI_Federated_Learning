# Secure_and_Private_AI_Federated_Learning
Federated Learning is a privacy preserving and secure way of collaborative and distributed learning.

This is an interdisciplinary field which loans theory from cryptography and statistics to facilitate private artificial intelligence. This repo will contain my walkthrough of the Andrew Trask course of Secure and Private AI
