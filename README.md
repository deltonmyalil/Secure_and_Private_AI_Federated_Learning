# Secure_and_Private_AI_Federated_Learning
Federated Learning is a privacy preserving and secure way of distributed collaborative learning. Here, model training can be done by the contribution of data from multiple parties without actually sharing the data with each other or a third party assuming multiple threat models. Instead of data, models or gradients are shared. This is an interdisciplinary field which loans theory from cryptography and statistics to facilitate private artificial intelligence. This repo will contain my walkthrough of the Andrew Trask course of Secure and Private AI.
